### About Me

I'm a Staff Software Engineer at **Pantheon Platform** with 8.5+ years of experience building resilient, scalable backend systems at enterprise scale. I specialize in platform engineering, microservices architecture, and cloud-native development — primarily with **Go**, **Kubernetes**, and **GCP**.

My work focuses on modernizing legacy systems, designing security-first architectures, and establishing engineering standards that help teams ship faster and more reliably. I've led projects that protect 100k+ customer sites, migrated critical infrastructure with zero downtime, and mentored engineers across multiple teams.

### Highlight Projects

#### 🔄 Legacy Microservices Modernization
Architected and led migration of multiple legacy Python microservices to Go using the strangler pattern. Achieved **300% performance improvement**, reduced incident frequency, and accelerated developer onboarding with standardized service templates and comprehensive observability.

#### 🔐 SSL Certificate Security Architecture
Designed and implemented a proxy-based architecture to isolate SSL certificates from customer workloads across **100k+ sites**. Delivered end-to-end with zero customer impact through a phased rollout strategy.

#### 🔗 Version Control Service (VCS)
Led from ideation to beta launch — a service enabling customers to connect GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket repos to Pantheon. Built on serverless architecture (Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Cloud SQL) with event-driven webhook processing. Reduced COGS by **60%** and customer tickets by **80%**.

#### 📊 Observability Platform
Integrated Grafana and Prometheus across microservices, established SLOs/SLIs, implemented distributed tracing, and created runbooks and alerting strategies — significantly improving system reliability and debugging speed.

#### 🛡️ SOC2 Compliance Mail Relay Migration
Migrated Postfix mail relay infrastructure with encryption at rest under tight compliance deadlines. Modernized deployment from Chef to Ansible with a region-based rollout strategy. Zero customer impact.

#### 🖼️ Microservices Built from Scratch
Designed and built several critical platform services: **VRT** (Visual Regression Testing), **Screenshot Service** (high-throughput capture), and **VCS** — each with Kubernetes-native deployment, HPA, CI/CD automation, and API-first design.
